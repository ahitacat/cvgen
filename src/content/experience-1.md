I have been working at CERN since the start of 2021, in two separate groups:
IT-CDA, where I worked on Indico; and IT-ST, on the EOS/CERNBox platform. During
this time, I've performed many different tasks:

* Design, implementation, test and deployment of **multiple brand new features**
  for Indico and CERNBox. (unlisted events, notification system, backend
  architecture).
* Creation of a **CERNBox-Indico integration**, enabling users to attach
  materials directly from the cloud.
* Implementation of a **CEPH driver** for the CERNBox backend.
* Migration of Indico's codebase to **Python 3** and refactor of extensive parts
  of the user interface into React.
* Improvements to Indico's authentication system to ensure its robustness.
* **Evaluation of feature requests** for Indico and CERNBox, interviewing with
  users for agile requirement acquisition. Taking into account security aspects,
  and additional constraints such as OC11/GDPR.
* **Support and day to day operation** of the EOS/CERNBox and Indico systems.
  Plan and execution of upgrade and maintenance operations to run the services
  with zero or minimal downtime.
* **Management and monitoring of production clusters** using tools like Puppet,
  OpenStack and Grafana.
* Speaker at **multiple conferences and workshops** in relation to Indico, and
  to CERNBox in the scope of the H2020-funded
  [CS³MESH⁴EOSC](https://cs3mesh4eosc.eu/) project, which partly funded my
  contract.
* **Selection, supervision and mentoring** of a Summer Student and Google Summer
  of Code student.
* **End-user support** for the worldwide Indico community (200+ instances), and
  the EOS/CERNBox user base.
