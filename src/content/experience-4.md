While getting my degree, I worked part-time for 8 years in a local software
company. I focused mainly on web development and systems administration. My
tasks included:

* Design and construction of web portals and applications with high
  availability.
* **Configuration and operation of enterprise servers**, as well
  as their on-premise deployment in the clients' sites.
* **Management of SLAs** between the company and clients.
* Set up a self-hosted mail service based on **Postfix/Dovecot** to replace the
  previous externally hosted one, reducing costs dramatically.
* Provide **client support** via email, phone and on-site visits.
