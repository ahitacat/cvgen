I worked for two years in [EMBL-EBI](https://ebi.ac.uk), the European Molecular
Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute, which focuses on big
data software services for life sciences. My duties were:

* Creation of **[identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org)**, a resolving system
  for life sciences IDs, which aims to help scientists adhere to **[FAIR
  principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)**. This service was
  developed under the umbrella of the European-Funded [Project
  Freya](https://www.project-freya.eu/en/front-page).
* Design and implementation of a submission validation suite for the **[Human
  Cell Atlas Project](https://www.humancellatlas.org/)** Data Ingest Service,
  using **Python 3** and **Neo4J**, a graph database.
* Frontend architecture design and implementation for the second version of the
  **[Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/)**.
* During the COVID-19 pandemic, I designed and developed the **[Open Targets
  COVID‑19 Target Prioritization
  Tool](https://blog.opentargets.org/covid-19-target-prioritisation-tool-released/)**
  from scratch. It was a fully client‑side application which aggregated all the
  viral target data known at that moment. The team was awarded a grant to
  integrate the data into the main platform.
